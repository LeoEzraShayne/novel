Chapter 3: Humans Are Born of Their Mothers…

I was locked alone in a room, feeling worried about the two girls, yet knowing I was powerless to help them at the moment. A man wearing a coronet and robe began interrogating me, and I heard the soldiers outside calling him Chief Fu.
Chief Fu stared at me, his expression grim, and asked, 'What's your name? Why were you with those two demons? Don't you know consorting with demons is a serious crime? It might even get you burned alongside them.'
Instinctively, I defended them, saying, 'They're just ordinary women, not demons.'
'You call them women?' Chief Fu seemed to find this the most absurd joke he'd ever heard.
'That's what they are.'
'If they're women, then why don't they have wings?'
'Um…' This question was too profound for me to answer.
'As a man, you've been seduced by the enemy, openly associating with demons and speaking for them.' He looked at me with disdain. 'Even if you weren't born when the demon race slaughtered Phoenix City, you must have heard of their bloodshed and cruelty. Aren't you ashamed of your position?'
'They really aren't demons,' I hurriedly explained. 'We're not from this world. In our world, women simply don't have wings.'
Chief Fu looked puzzled. 'You mean… you're from the Sea of the Otherworlds?'
I didn't know what the Sea of the Otherworlds was, but I nodded vigorously.
Chief Fu paced back and forth, deep in thought, then turned to the soldiers and said, 'Take him with us.'
I was dragged along.
Chief Fu led the way, with two soldiers escorting me from behind. Along the way, I saw many armed people and some women with wings, either perched on rooftops or flying in the sky. There were also male soldiers, sturdy and martial, some riding beasts I had never seen before.
We arrived at a palace, where Chief Fu stopped. Before long, I saw someone bringing Zhang Lian and Xie Tingting over, and their condition filled me with anger.
Zhang Lian was covered in whip marks, yet her eyes still sparkled with defiant anger. Xie Tingting was in slightly better shape, but there were traces of blood between her trembling fingers, indicating she had been tortured. The soldiers around them looked at them with disgust and hatred. Perhaps I wasn't treated equally because I wasn't considered one of these "demons" in their eyes.
When Chief Fu looked at the people beside Zhang Lian and Xie Tingting and asked a few questions, he said, 'Bring these three inside and let Prince Jingeng decide how to deal with them.' Chief Fu walked into the palace.
A young man in elaborate attire stood on the steps of the main hall, while an old man lounged in a chair below.
When the young man saw us enter, he descended the steps and said to Chief Fu, 'Chief Fu, I heard you've caught two demonesses. Are they the ones behind you?'
The young man glanced at Zhang Lian and then at Xie Tingting. When he looked at Xie Tingting, he seemed surprised by her beauty, a hint of astonishment flashing in his eyes.
'Your Highness, indeed they are,' Chief Fu bowed to the young man. 'However, they deny being demonesses and claim that the three of them are all from the Sea of the Otherworlds.'
'The Sea of the Otherworlds?' Prince Jingeng asked, bewildered.
'Yes,' Chief Fu replied. 'There are records about the Sea of the Otherworlds in historical texts. They come from a place different from ours, for various reasons ended up in our world. Though they have a distinction between males and females, the females, despite resembling demonesses, are fundamentally not of the demon race. Besides lacking wings, they are no different from us.'
'Ah, I have read about this,' Prince Jingeng nodded. 'It seems that every so often, there are drifters from the Sea of the Otherworlds. The Peacock King even married a woman from there, and their daughter, though born with wings, was otherwise indistinguishable from ordinary people. However, how can you be sure they are truly from the Sea of the Otherworlds and not demonesses?'
Chief Fu glanced at one of the soldiers escorting the two girls. The soldier stepped forward and knelt before Prince Jingeng, reporting, 'Your Highness, as ordered by Chief Fu, I tricked them into drinking water mixed with Dongming grass extract during interrogation. It has been two quarters of an hour since.'
I discreetly glanced at Zhang Lian and Xie Tingting, who exchanged a puzzled look before nodding slightly. Zhang Lian muttered in complaint, 'No wonder that water tasted strange.'
Chief Fu explained, 'Dongming grass is the bane of demons. If they were truly demonesses, the Dongming grass would reveal their true forms. So far, they may indeed not be demonesses, but in recent years, the demon race has been trying to find ways to resist the effects of Dongming grass. Perhaps they have found a way to counteract its effects, or perhaps not.'
'What should we do then? If they are demonesses, we cannot let them go. But if they are truly from the Sea of the Otherworlds, killing innocent people would be unjust,' Prince Jingeng turned to the old man lounging in the chair beside him. 'Teacher, do you have any suggestions?'
The old man suddenly woke up from his daze. 'What, what? Are we going to war?'
Prince Jingeng cleared his throat and repeated the question.
'Ah, this, this is too simple,' the old man brushed his beard.
'So, Teacher, you do have a solution?' Prince Jingeng asked eagerly. 'Please share.'
I and Zhang Lian, Xie Tingting nervously looked at the old man, hoping he could find a way to clear their suspicions.
'There's a saying you may not have heard before,' the old man found himself the center of everyone's attention and appeared quite pleased with himself.
I couldn't help but interject, 'What saying?'
The old man waggled his head and said, 'Humans are born of their mothers, demons are born of their mothers.'
Me: "…"
This saying sounds somewhat familiar.
Prince Jingeng modestly asked, 'Teacher, what do you mean by that?'
"Though demonesses may resemble human women, they are ultimately not human. Even if they engage in intimacy with human men, they cannot conceive. However, it's different for the Sea of the Otherworlds inhabitants. According to past records, they are essentially humans like us, born in another world. So…'
'So… what?' Prince Jingeng asked the old man, but his eyes were starting to stray toward Xie Tingting.
And I had a bad feeling about it.
'So,' the old man said, 'as long as we find a few men to be intimate with them repeatedly, if they can conceive, it proves they are human and not demonesses. If they remain unable to conceive, then they are likely demonesses.'
'You old bastard, what kind of despicable idea is this?' Zhang
Lian cursed angrily, and Xie Tingting blushed deeply.
'Uh,' Prince Jingeng appeared to be contemplating deeply. 'If this is the only solution, then we have no choice but to proceed this way. However, the selection of men for intimacy is a problem. After all, they may indeed be evil demonesses. Engaging with them intimately might not only risk lives but could also lead to death. Alas, as a prince, I should take on this dangerous task with a sense of duty, responsibility, and courage…'
Duty, your ass!
Could you stop speaking while stealing glances at Miss Xie Tingting? Let me tell you, it's lucky this is your turf; if it were in our school, you would have been minced into meat sauce by now.
Prince Jingeng ignored my angry glare and said, 'Alright, let's proceed…'
'Your Highness, this is not appropriate,' fortunately, Chief Fu quickly intervened.
'Ah, what's inappropriate?' Prince Jingeng inquired.
Chief Fu spoke loudly, 'If they are demonesses, the men who are intimate with them are likely to be in danger, especially distinguished individuals like Your Highness. We must not take such risks. If they are not demonesses, then our actions would be akin to bullying defenseless women, no different from beasts.'
Indeed, this Chief Fu is the most righteous one.
'Ah, I see,' the young Prince cleared his throat. 'Then, according to your opinion, what should we do?'
Chief Fu said, 'Since it's difficult to distinguish, why not just assume they are demonesses and send them to the stake? It's better to kill by mistake than to let them go.'
You are more wicked than that damned Prince…'
