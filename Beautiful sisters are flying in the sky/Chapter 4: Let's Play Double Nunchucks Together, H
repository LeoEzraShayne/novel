Chapter 4: Let's Play Double Nunchucks Together, Hey Hey Ha Hei!

"Actually, there's another way," the old man who had just suggested the slimming idea said, "this method is much simpler."
"Teacher, please go on," Prince Jinguang asked.
"The significant difference between the Yaksha and the Sea People," the old man said, "is that the Yaksha lack musical sense. They cannot sing even the shortest piece of music, nor can they handle even the simplest musical instrument. Whereas the Sea People, like us, also have a sense of musical rhythm in their world..."
"I see," Prince Jinguang clapped his hands and had some musical instruments brought over by servants. He looked at Zhang Lian and Xie Tingting, "Regardless of which instrument you use, as long as you can play a complete piece of music, you can prove that you are not demons."
"You are the demons!" Zhang Lian muttered, looking at those instruments she basically didn't recognize, and asked, "Is there a guitar, or a piano? If not, an electronic keyboard will do."
Prince Jinguang and Chief Fu exchanged glances, obviously not knowing what Zhang Lian was talking about.
But in my heart, I bitterly smiled... I've known this girl since kindergarten, and I'm very, very sure that even if these people really brought out guitars and pianos... she wouldn't know how to use them.
She just never learned these things.
"Singing, can that work?" she raised an eyebrow.
The old man nodded, "Yes."
"Wait a minute," I quickly exclaimed, "why not let Tingting go first?"
"Die Yunnuo, what do you mean by this," Zhang Lian began to get angry, "don't you trust me?"
Does this guy even realize that this is a matter of life and death? I desperately winked at her.
Chief Fu took a step forward, coldly staring at me, my impatience undoubtedly seemed like a sign of guilt... which it was.
"I'll start singing," Zhang Lian proudly cleared her throat.
Prince Jinguang, the old man, Chief Fu, and the soldiers behind us all perked up their ears, ready to listen to how well this seemingly confident girl could sing. Even Tingting's eyes were filled with anticipation, hoping that Zhang Lian could dispel their suspicion of them being "demons" with her singing.
But my heart was sinking, like falling into an abyss without a bottom.
Zhang Lian sang Jay Chou's "Double Nunchucks"... yes, that song "Let's play double nunchucks together, hey hey ha hei..."
She always liked Jay Chou's songs.
Xie Tingting widened her eyes, Prince Jinguang and the old man exchanged glances, Chief Fu and those soldiers all seemed uncomfortable, looking like they were considering plugging their ears with something.
I felt like I was going to faint.
After finishing her song, Zhang Lian still confidently asked, "How was that? Now you should believe that I'm not the 'demon' you say I am, right?"
Tingting grabbed my arm in fear, obviously guessing what the outcome would be, although she still looked towards the others with a hint of hope, hoping that the goddess of luck would suddenly descend, and these people would have almost zero appreciation for music... although I thought it was a dream.
"It seems the answer is quite clear," Prince Jinguang sighed heavily, "they are indeed Yaksha women, Chief Fu, take them to the execution ground!"
"Wait a minute," I quickly shouted, "even hens can't lay eggs, and roosters can't crow. Although this woman is tone-deaf, a tone-deaf woman is still a woman, not a demon. You should give us another chance..."
"Hey, what do you mean?" Zhang Lian yelled angrily, "I sang badly? How could I sing badly? Do you even have any musical cells?"
"Shut up," I shouted back at her. Clearly tone-deaf, yet she still went on to sing that "hey hey ha hei" stuff. Does she realize she's asking for trouble?
"What are you trying to do?" she even shouted back, "They can burn me, but they can't insult my character. I clearly sang so well..."
Does this woman even have a brain?
"That's enough," Chief Fu impatiently scolded, commanding the soldiers, "Take them away, to the execution ground."
"What about this person?" one of the soldiers pointed at me.
"To defend Yaksha women is to betray humanity," Chief Fu said coldly, "Execute him too."
Zhang Lian seemed to realize at this moment what mistake she had made, her face paled for a moment. And I could only sigh unlucky... Rather than watching the two of them being burned to death while I survived, it's better to die with them.
Just then, Tingting suddenly rushed forward, grabbed something resembling a guzheng from the instruments. Two soldiers came to drag her away, but she knelt down and held onto the guzheng tightly, looking at Prince Jinguang with a plaintive look.
Perhaps her appearance was too pitiful, which softened Prince Jinguang's heart, he waved his hand, letting the soldiers step back.
Chief Fu frowned, "Your Highness..."
Prince Jinguang smiled, "Since they are two individuals, they should each have a chance. It won't hurt to let her play a piece, and if it's still unpleasant, we can execute them later."
Zhang Lian opened her mouth, obviously wanting to murmur something like "I clearly sang so well." I fiercely glared at her this time, and this time, she finally shut her mouth and didn't say another word.
I feel like one day I'm going to be killed by this girl with a few less brain cells.
...
Tingting knelt on the ground, placing the instrument, somewhat resembling a guzheng, in front of her legs. She plucked each string with her fingers, seemingly judging the pitch of each string.
"Why does this guzheng have so many strings?" Zhang Lian whispered beside me.
Chief Fu and Prince Jinguang glanced at her, but said nothing. It was Tingting who answered softly, "This is not a guzheng, this is a qin."
So it's not a guzheng? I looked at Zhang Lian, seeing her face turning red from holding back.
Since she doesn't recognize it, shouldn't she shut up like I did? Idiot.
But since Tingting recognized this thing, I also felt somewhat relieved.
Putting the qin on the ground, our school flower began to play. Her fingerwork was nimble, and the sound of the strings lingered... At first, it was like a bird flying into the woods, fluttering its wings from time to time, chirping. Before long, the string sound became suppressed, as if there were dark clouds gathering, and the wind was raging, the bird's call became panicked and tiny.
Soon, the string sound became urgent, like a mountain rain pouring down, overwhelming.
I secretly observed, seeing the old man listening attentively, Chief Fu and Prince Jinguang nodding secretly, which finally relieved me completely.
Indeed, our school flower classmate was trustworthy
, not only was she beautiful and academically excellent, but she also learned many other skills.
If Zhang Lian is earth, then Tingting is heaven, the gap between them is like the difference between earth and heaven...
If I could marry Tingting in the future, that would be great.
I imagined Tingting singing to me naked at home, a wonderful scene, and my blood rushed, almost causing a nosebleed. In the picture, after Tingting finished singing, she looked shyly at me, "Senior, do you, do you want to hear anything else?"
I smirked and approached her, "I want you to... play... the flute..."
Just as I was fantasizing in my mind, the string sound suddenly changed. It became chaotic, like a group of crows squawking in the jungle, noisy and unpleasant.
No way? I just praised her in my heart, and she immediately ran into trouble?
Is she also like Zhang Lian, hopeless?
The old man and Prince Jinguang frowned, while Chief Fu snorted.
I looked at Tingting, seeing her leaning forward, her fingers frantically plucking the strings. Her expression was so blank, as if she didn't even know what she was doing.
"Men, come here," Chief Fu ordered... He seemed to have concluded that both Tingting and Zhang Lian were "demons" and wanted them dragged away.
I was prepared to fight these people to the death.
However, the string sound suddenly changed again.
Tingting's body continued to tremble, her fingers continued to bleed from the strings. However, the crazy plucking produced a brand new melody, one that was refreshing. Initially, it was like an elf dancing in the flames, sometimes fluttering its wings, sometimes chirping. Soon, the string sound became urgent, like a mountain rainstorm, overwhelming the world.
I stole a glance and saw the old man suddenly standing up from his chair, showing a shocked expression with Prince Jinguang. I saw Chief Fu standing there, looking puzzled. I even saw those soldiers, some with blank expressions, some quietly shedding tears, obviously the same touch had entered their hearts.
But Tingting seemed to be the only one unaware of her surroundings, just continuously plucking the strings. Her expression was so blank, as if she didn't even know what she was doing.
"Stop!" Chief Fu stepped forward and kicked the qin away. The string sound stopped, and the whole hall became quiet, so quiet that you could hear a pin drop.
However, the lingering sound of the melody still reverberated in everyone's hearts, making it unforgettable.
Although the hall was extremely quiet, even unnervingly quiet, there was a commotion outside. Someone rushed in anxiously, and Chief Fu frowned, asking, "What's going on?"
"Your Highness, Chief Fu," the person answered anxiously, "just now, there was a wave of music covering the entire city, and many people came asking what happened."
The music just now spread throughout the entire city?
"There's nothing wrong," Chief Fu said coldly, "let them go back to their posts, no one is allowed to discuss this matter, nor to spread it outside. Anyone who disobeys will be executed... understood?"
The person left as ordered.
"Your Highness," Chief Fu looked at Prince Jinguang, asking quietly, "the music just now, could it be..."
Prince Jinguang and the old man exchanged glances, and the old man nodded, "Absolutely right, what she just played was... the Immortal Melody 'Love Sky'!"
I didn't know what 'Love Sky' was, and I didn't care. I just held Tingting tightly, trying to calm her down.
But she coughed up blood and fainted in my arms...
What exactly happened just now?"
