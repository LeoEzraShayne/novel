Chapter 8: Little White Rabbit, White and White...


"Rabbit?" Several people looked at each other in confusion. Ah Mu humbly asked, "Arnold... What is a rabbit?"
These people didn't even recognize a rabbit? In that moment, I felt quite proud and accomplished because since coming here, this was the first time I encountered something I knew but others didn't: "A rabbit is just a rabbit. Due to different fur colors, they are divided into white rabbits, black rabbits, gray rabbits. They are timid creatures; at the sight of danger, they immediately flee..."
"Can it breathe fire?" Miss Luo asked excitedly.
"...No."
"Does it shoot lightning? Or does it have psychic attacks? Or maybe it has the ability to change the weather at will?"
"Well... it seems not."
"Then what can it do?" Miss Luo asked in frustration. "I see its teeth are so long. Does it mean they're poisonous, delivering a deadly bite?"
"Well... not that I know of." I hadn't heard of rabbits biting people.
"Oh, right," Miss Shelley asked from the side, "what does it eat? I offered it raw meat in the morning, but it refused to eat. It seemed famished."
Feeding a rabbit raw meat? I was flabbergasted. With a sigh, I replied, "Rabbits are herbivores. Their favorite food is carrots..."
"Carrots?" Miss Luo looked disappointed. "Okay, just tell me, how capable is this little thing in a fight? Can one rabbit take on how many tigers?"
"Well, I think... one tiger could probably handle about a hundred rabbits?"
"So useless," Miss Luo disdainfully glanced at the innocent little white rabbit. "No wonder so few people have seen this thing. I thought it might be on the level of phoenixes or flying dragons, or at least a sub-level mythical creature. Turns out, the reason these beasts are nearly extinct isn't because they're precious, but because they're utterly useless, anyone can bully them."
"I always thought such a small thing couldn't be some powerful mythical beast," Miss Shelley complained. "It's just that you insisted it might be one of those seemingly weak creatures that can actually breathe fire or something, making us waste a trip."
"How would I know," Miss Luo snorted. "I originally thought that regardless, since this little guy appeared in the Fire Cloud Valley, it must have some kind of extraordinary aspect. Looks like I was wrong. It's probably caught by that unicorn as food in the Fire Cloud Valley, only lucky enough to survive when other mythical beasts fought the unicorn."
The two misses and the big man discussed for a while, feeling certain about it. In the meantime, Ah Mu went to find some vegetables to stuff into the cage, and the little white rabbit indeed nibbled on them with relish. Miss Luo appeared even more disappointed upon seeing it was truly a vegetarian creature.
"Never mind," Miss Luo tossed the cage in front of me and Ah Mu. "Just sell this useless little thing to the zoo, name your price."
Ah Mu quickly said, "Um... we need to wait for the boss to decide."
I looked at the little white rabbit, noticing a deep wound on its body, the torn flesh and blood making it pitiful. Seeing it munching on vegetables without much vigor, it seemed it wouldn't live much longer. I felt soft-hearted for a moment and said, "How about selling it to me? I'll offer..."
Suddenly, I realized I didn't have much money on me, and spending the hard-earned Qingtong leaves in a place like this...
"Never mind, never mind. Just give this useless little thing to you," Miss Luo grabbed the little white rabbit from the cage and tossed it directly to me.
Ah Mu looked at the backs of the two misses and the big man leaving, sighing, "Miss Luo, Miss Shelley, Mr. Gongshu might be the famous Hunting Trio of Dahao, but they dared to go to the Fire Cloud Valley to hunt unicorns, they're really brave. You know, many famous hunters have entered the Fire Cloud Valley before, but none of them came out alive. Just the miasma around the Fire Cloud Valley has killed countless people."
I wasn't interested in that Hunting Trio or the Fire Cloud Valley; I just thought this little white rabbit was too severely wounded. So, I asked Ah Mu to fetch some herbs from the veterinarian.
As I applied the herbs to its wound, it lay still on my lap. Two red lights burst out of its eyes, then disappeared.
I was taken aback, carefully picked it up, and looked into its eyes, but couldn't see anything special.
Did my eyes deceive me just now?
...
"Little White Rabbit, White and White, bound up with four feet up in the air..."
Zhang Lian excitedly came with a rope to tie up the pitiful little white rabbit.
"What are you doing?" I quickly snatched it away and held it in my arms.
"Opening it up and cooking it," she looked at me puzzled, "weren't you buying it for food?"
"Well," Xie Tingting timidly said, "it's so cute and injured like this, so pitiful. Senior, Zhang Lian... how could you bear to eat it?"
"Hey," I sighed, "don't equate me with this barbaric woman, okay? I never intended to eat it."
"Who's the barbaric woman?" The barbaric woman glared at me fiercely. "Besides, your salary is so little, we haven't had meat in ages. Now that we finally have rabbit meat to eat..."
"Alright, alright," I shrugged, "not earning enough to afford meat is my fault..."
After I said that, Zhang Lian seemed a little embarrassed, turning her head away, "I didn't mean to say you're useless. It's already quite difficult for you to support the three of us with your salary alone. I just thought since there's a rabbit here, cooking it for a meal could help..."
I looked at Xie Tingting, seeing that her body hadn't fully recovered after a serious illness, and thought that what she said wasn't entirely wrong. So, why not stew this rabbit... even though it's a rare animal here.
The little white rabbit seemed to sense our ill intentions and began to struggle.
"Let's not eat it, okay?" Xie Tingting softened her heart in the end and said softly, "I think it's really pitiful, being captured in this unfamiliar place, could be killed at any moment... just like us."
Hearing her say that, both Zhang Lian and I felt a sense of camaraderie with this little rabbit. So, we abandoned the idea of stewing it for now.
"Since we're keeping it, let's give it a name." Zhang Lian reached out to touch the little white rabbit, and it turned its head and bit her finger. She pulled her hand back with a cry, annoyed, "It bit me."
"Rabbits bite people?" Xie Tingting curiously leaned over, but the little white rabbit jumped out of my hand and pounced on her chest, nuzzling.
"It tickles," she laughed, her back's new pair of pristine white wings flapping.
At this moment, she was wearing a ankle-length
emerald green dress, with only two ribbons hanging over her shoulders, half-open at the back, just enough to possibly allow her wings that hadn't fully grown out to stretch. A flower was pinned to her chest, revealing a shallow cleavage... this ankle-length dress was bought cheaply by me at the market, unexpectedly fitting her perfectly. It seemed my long-time "visual estimation" of Xie Campus Flower was still quite accurate.
The little white rabbit rubbed against her, and one of its feet ended up in her cleavage.
Why am I not the little white rabbit... at this moment, I really wanted to stew this little white rabbit and then turn into it myself.
Looking at Zhang Lian again, she was only wearing a more masculine coarse shirt, because I considered that without wings, she would easily be mistaken for a "demoness", so I might as well dress her like a man. The Qingtong leaves spent on this rough shirt didn't even amount to half of the one Xie Campus Flower wore. To be honest, even I felt a bit biased, but she never complained about anything.
"Oh right, we were going to give it a name, right?" I reached out for the little white rabbit nestled against Xie Tingting's chest... Actually, I wished its body would turn into foam, so my hand could penetrate without hindrance.
"Its fur is white, so let's call it Little White," Xie Tingting said happily.
Is that name too simple? Although I thought so, I still vigorously nodded, "Yeah, that's a good name, very cute. From now on, this will be its home, you are its mommy, and I am its daddy..."
Xie School Flower blushed, not knowing where to look, her face suddenly charming.
"What about me?" Zhang Lian gave me a sidelong glance.
"You're its grandmother... oh!"
The barbaric woman kicked over...
