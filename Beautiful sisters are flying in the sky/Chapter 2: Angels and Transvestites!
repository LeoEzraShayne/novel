Chapter 2: Angels and Transvestites!

Where am I?
I gazed around at the towering trees that pierced the sky. There couldn't be trees this tall on Earth. The sky was tinted with a jade-like clarity, with wisps of clouds drifting as if etched onto glass. Strange birds flew among the trees, unlike any I'd ever seen.
Could I have traveled through time?
I was on the brink of being drowned by the river, but now I woke up in this strange place. Besides time travel, I couldn't think of any other explanation. But if I had traveled, where were Zhang Lian and Xie Tingting? Did they also travel with me?
I ran among these unbelievably tall trees, continuously calling out their names.
"You won't find them like this!" A voice suddenly sounded behind me.
I turned around to see a small, skinny figure in a black robe, barely reaching my waist, holding an ugly wooden staff. His face was completely hidden in the shadows of his hood, his voice hoarse as if intentionally disguised. "I know who you're looking for and I can help you find them, but there's a condition."
"Who are you?" I stared at the small figure.
"Who I am doesn't matter, as long as you do as I say... Hey, don't walk away!"
"Sorry," I couldn't be bothered with him, "I'm not interested in doing what anyone says."
"I told you not to go!" The guy actually chased after me, hitting the back of my head with his staff, making me see stars. "I haven't finished speaking yet."
Anger surged within me. I turned around and grabbed his hood, pulling it up to reveal the black robe falling from him: it was a little girl... no, an angel! Because she had a pair of pure white and adorable wings.
"What are you doing?" The little angel flew up and fiercely hit my head with the staff.
"Are you sent by God?" I winced. God, even if you're sending an angel to guide me, couldn't you send one with a better temper?
"God? Who's that? I don't know him. Listen," the little angel flew in the air, pointing the staff at me menacingly, "I want you to do something. If you don't, I'll have to eliminate you on behalf of my mom."
"On behalf of her mom? Isn't it on behalf of God?" Or does her mother happen to be the Virgin Mary, and she's Jesus Christ's sister?
Regardless, considering she's an angel, I decided I should still listen to what she wanted me to do. So, with devout respect and fear, I looked at her, awaiting the instructions from the Virgin Mary.
The little angel rummaged through herself and found a small bottle containing red liquid. She opened it. "Drink this."
"What is this?" I asked cautiously.
"I told you to drink it." The little angel threw her staff away and suddenly rushed at me, legs gripping my neck, left hand pressing my head, and the right hand pouring the blood-red liquid into my mouth. Surprisingly, her tiny body had astonishing strength, and I had no chance to resist.
The red liquid flowed down my throat, tasting like blood.
"That's the way." She let go of my neck, landing on the ground to pick up her staff, then smirked at me. "Welcome to the Starless Continent. You'll encounter some minor difficulties on your journey, but they'll pass quickly. You must keep going and not disappoint me, understand? Dad..."
"What did you call me?"
"Ah? N-nothing," the little angel seemed flustered, "I, I said 'take'... Yes, I meant 'take' courage, yeah, that's it. Alright, nothing to worry about, I'll leave now... Oops!"
She crashed into a tree and fell down.
I hurried over, catching her in time... she was quite a clumsy little angel.
She stared at me dumbfoundedly in my arms, then suddenly kissed my cheek happily and flew away. "Oh, almost forgot to tell you, go in that direction, and you'll find the ones you're looking for."
She pointed behind me and added, "Considering you caught me just now, I can give you a free piece of advice."
She extended a finger. "Don't worry about Mommy; she's just going through... Okay, that's all from me, bye-bye! Don't miss me too much, anyway, you can't do without me in the future. Goodbye."
And she flew away... and I had no idea what she was talking about.
God, how could you send such a strange angel to see me?
Thinking of the liquid she forced me to drink, I touched my stomach, feeling nothing uncomfortable. Then I wondered if it was some kind of elixir that could give infinite strength? So I jumped up and threw a few punches, but didn't feel any stronger.
Forget it...
I shrugged and headed in the direction the little angel had pointed.
Not long after, I emerged from the woods and saw Zhang Lian and Xie Tingting standing side by side on a hill. They looked surprised and relieved when they noticed me.
"Senior," Xie Tingting was so excited she almost cried, "I thought...!"
"She's been cursing you, saying you're done for," Zhang Lian shrugged, "But I'm better. I said you have a cockroach's fate, not that easy to die. At most, missing a limb or two."
"I didn't curse Senior," Xie Tingting hastily defended herself.
I certainly believed her. I walked over to them and asked, "What are you two looking at?"
"Look over there," Zhang Lian pointed in the distance.
In that direction, a huge airship was slowly flying across the sky, resembling something you'd only see in certain cartoons. A ramp stretched out, leading towards a massive stone city with flags waving atop its walls.
"I think we might...," Zhang Lian said cautiously.
"Yeah," I said confidently, "we must have crossed over."
"But, how is that possible?" Xie Tingting whispered.
"What's impossible about it?" Zhang Lian scoffed, "And I think, for us, crossing over to another world is better than drowning in the river."
I thought the same.
"On the other hand," I glanced at Zhang Lian, "They were coming to capture Tingting, why did you run with us?"
"Did you think I wanted to run?" Zhang Lian was a bit annoyed, "When a group of people came at us with machetes and I saw you guys turning around to run, my first reaction was to run with you? If I had known, I should've gone to the side and let them chop you to death."
This wicked girl.
"Anyway," I said, "regardless, let's go see what's going on there."
Staying here wasn't an option.
The slope was a bit slippery, and I noticed Xie Tingting seemed exhausted, so I reached out to cautiously support her. I heard Zhang Lian's barely audible complaints in my ear, "Hmph, always so nice to her."
I pretended not to hear.
We descended the slope and headed towards the gate of the stone city. Dozens of Pegasus flew
overhead, confirming to us that this wasn't our original world.
There were many stalls on both sides of the gate, resembling a market. People dressed in long robes with headscarves bustled about, making us feel like we'd gone back to ancient times. However, ancient times wouldn't have flying airships, nor have heard of horses with wings.
Approaching a stall, I said, "Excuse me..."
"Want to buy something?" The man smiled, looking up at us. Honestly, being able to understand him immediately relieved us. Though his accent was odd, at least it meant we could communicate with the people here.
However, he suddenly widened his eyes when he saw Xie Tingting, and I guessed he was struck by her beauty. But his eyes were filled with fear and terror, so much so that Xie Tingting couldn't help but touch her own face, wondering if she'd suddenly sprouted flowers.
"Transvestites!" The man yelled, abandoning his stall and fleeing. Others looked over, their faces pale with fear.
Transvestites? Zhang Lian and I exchanged a glance, thinking our school's renowned beauty had become a transvestite here?
"You two transvestites!" Someone shouted, "Quick, call the guards!"
"How did you two end up being labeled as transvestites?" Zhang Lian's voice sounded somewhat gloating.
"It's not us two," I said, "it's you two... you and Tingting!"
Only then did Zhang Lian notice that those people were pointing at her and Xie Tingting, and she was instantly furious.
The sound of hooves came from inside the city, soldiers riding horses with spears. The three of us panicked and turned to run.
There were also urgent flapping of wings behind us. In my panic, I turned to look and then froze in place.
"Aren't you going to run?" Zhang Lian shouted.
"You can't escape." Xie Tingting also saw what was flying towards us.
Flying out from the city wall were a group of women with bows and arrows. They wore blue robes and all had wings on their backs, resembling angels only seen in movies.
They quickly caught up to us, and the archers aimed their bows at us. The three of us, back to back, formed a triangle, none daring to move.
Another woman with wings flew over, not very old, dressed in blue instead of green, and holding a short spear instead of a bow. "Bold of you," the woman in blue flew overhead, looking down coldly at us, but I felt she was really looking at Zhang Lian and Xie Tingting, while I was just a bystander in her eyes, "for transvestites to dare show up here."
Zhang Lian was enraged. "You're the transvestite, all of you are!"
To be honest, I didn't know whether to admire Zhang Lian's courage or laugh at her lack of brains. Being threatened with bows and arrows and still daring to be so arrogant.
"Capture them!" the woman in blue shouted, and the soldiers rushed forward, pressing us to the ground and tying us up with ropes. Xie Tingting cried in confusion, and Zhang Lian continued to curse.
I, on the other hand, remained calm, realizing what had happened. The people here were similar to those in our world, with men and women. Men looked similar to those in our world, just dressed differently, but the women... they all had wings.
I began to understand that maybe the little girl I met in the forest wasn't an angel after all. She was probably just an ordinary girl... because the little girls here all had wings.
As I looked around, I realized that Zhang Lian and Xie Tingting were likely the only two women in this stone city without wings.
And such women... they were called 'transvestites' here!"
