Chapter 1: Before Crossing...

As for whether there is destiny in this world, I have never dared to be certain. However, the connections between people do have many incredible wonders. The past feels like a series of dreams, and even now, looking back, it still feels somewhat unreal to me. Yet, the hardships and luck, as well as the people who may have died or are still alive, have left indelible marks on my life.
I, Yun Nuo, was just an ordinary high school student until I encountered that destined accident. It was unexpected because before that day, I never imagined such a turning point in my life. It was destined because now, looking back, perhaps there was indeed a plan in the works, and chance always hides within inevitability, only I couldn't see through it at the time.
Between people, there are always invisible ties. You never know where destiny will take you... until it begins to unfold.
On that morning, I left home as usual and set out for school. A lazy voice sounded behind me: "Yun Nuo." The voice was too familiar to me, so I tried to pretend I hadn't heard it. However, she called out two more times, louder each time, so reluctantly, I turned back.
Behind me was a short-haired girl wearing the same school uniform as me. She held fried chicken in one hand, a drink in the other, and books tucked under her arm. She was walking and eating without any grace, and she looked like she had just woken up.
This girl's name was Zhang Lian, and to some extent, she could be considered my "childhood sweetheart". After all, we had known each other since kindergarten and had been in the same class all the way until now.
Zhang Lian wasn't particularly pretty, but she was still quite pleasant to look at. Although her hair wasn't very smooth, it was shiny and black. Her nose was fairly straight, and her lips had a natural rosy color, though they were a bit thick. The school uniform hung loosely on her, and the skirt swayed irregularly with her movements, making it seem too loose-fitting... Of course, this matched her usual image.
Her image was... "lack of image".
She had no manners, no posture, and could sleep through every class.
In general, having a childhood sweetheart, a girl who grew up with you from childhood, to go to and from school together is a dream that many boys cherish.
But I never felt happy about it. Perhaps because I was too familiar with her, I knew very well how "unlovable" this girl was, who was always late for class and had worse grades than me.
"Wow, eating so well early in the morning, life is good, huh?" I said with a sarcastic smile at Zhang Lian.
"What do you want?" Zhang Lian shrank her food.
"Cough, I just wanted to ask about the seventy yuan you borrowed from me last month. Can you pay me back some of it these days? I..."
"No money." Zhang Lian cut me off without blinking.
"Hey, you're having such a good breakfast, and you say you have no money?"
"It's because I'm having such a good breakfast that I have no money."
"How about paying back a little?"
"I have nothing."
"These days, debtors are more imposing than creditors." I muttered to myself.
Seeing several students in the same uniform rushing past us, I said, "Hey, if you keep walking so slowly, we'll be late."
"Being late is okay. Does it matter?"
"I don't want to be late. I'll go first, okay?"
"No!"
"Why?"
"Because..." Zhang Lian tilted her head and thought for a moment, but couldn't come up with a good excuse, so she simply said, "No reason, just no."
"Fine, I won't bother with you." I took big steps and ran off. She yelled behind me, but I ignored her.
Being late wasn't a big deal, but being late with this unimpressive girl would make people question my taste.
I had only run a short distance when a car suddenly stopped beside me, and a girl much cuter than Zhang Lian stuck her head out: "Um, senior, are you going to school?"
This question was a bit redundant, but I didn't mind.
This girl's name was Xie Tingting.
If there were a vote for the "least lovely girl in the school," I would definitely cast my vote for Zhang Lian.
But if there were a vote for the "cutest girl in the school," I would unquestionably vote for Xie Tingting. Of course, she probably didn't need my vote; there were too many people willing to choose her as the school flower.
"Senior, would you like me to give you a ride?" The girl's face blushed slightly.
My heart pounded a few times, and I almost agreed, but in the end, I politely declined. Going to school with the school's well-known flower might get me stabbed by her fans.
"Well then," Xie Tingting hesitated for a moment, then gathered courage, "I'll walk with you, senior."
She actually got out of the car and had the driver drive back. But the driver was faithful to his duty and insisted on taking her to school, so she had to let the car drive slowly ahead while she followed behind with me.
To be honest, this surprised me.
But from another perspective, it wasn't so strange. Back in junior high, Xie Tingting and I already knew each other. At that time, she wasn't as pretty as she is now, and her dad wasn't as rich as he is now. Our families were neighbors, and she and I were even classmates. But later, she took a year off from school due to illness.
As we walked side by side, I discreetly glanced at her.
The school uniform on her seemed like it was specially designed for her. The simple collar and delicate long hair perfectly complemented her cute face with a hint of childishness. The unwrinkled clothes naturally matched her figure, making her look slender, like a plum blossom blooming in the winter snow. Honestly, I never knew our school's outdated girls' uniform could look so wonderful on a girl.
Looking back, Zhang Lian was still walking slowly.
The same school uniform worn by different people makes such a big difference?
Zhang Lian glared fiercely.
They say women undergo a transformation at eighteen. Xie Tingting was getting more and more beautiful, while Zhang Lian was becoming more and more unimpressive...
"Let's wait for her," Xie Tingting apparently misunderstood my reason for looking back at Zhang Lian.
"No need," I quickly said, "at her speed, we'll definitely be late."
So the two of us continued walking, and along the way, Xie Tingting whispered, "Um, there's something I want to tell you, senior. There's a party at my house tonight, and I, I'd like to invite you to come."
"A party?" I thought about it. I didn't mind attending a party, but considering I might encounter her obnoxious and pretentious dad, I felt a bit uncomfortable. Ever since her dad made his fortune from the coal factory, he became very arrogant, looking down not only
on poor kids like me but also liked to make snide remarks... Especially about me.
I really don't know when I offended him.
"Today is my birthday." The girl's face blushed slightly.
Is that so? I thought, looks like I'll have to endure her dad's ridicule again.
Just then, a black car suddenly emerged from an alley ahead, crashing into the car that was taking Xie Tingting to school.
It wasn't an accident; we stood stunned for a moment, then rushed forward to see if the driver was injured. But a group of people got out of the black car, some holding machetes, some holding ropes, and one holding... a gun.
It wasn't a car accident; it was a kidnapping.
"The girl isn't here!" Someone noticed that there was only the driver in the car and shouted loudly. Then there was a flash of blood, and someone hacked the driver several times.
"Could it be that our plan was discovered by Mr. Xie, so he didn't let his daughter go to school?" The kidnapper holding the gun looked a bit agitated, looking around suddenly.
I wanted to shield Xie Tingting with my body, but it was too late.
"She's over there." The kidnapper pointed with his finger.
I grabbed the still-dazed girl and ran back, but the gang of kidnappers chased after us with their knives. It wasn't until Xie Tingting and I ran past Zhang Lian that she screamed and dropped her drink and fried chicken, scared to turn and run with us.
I really wanted to ask her why she was running away with us when those people weren't after her.
The black car caught up, blocking our path, and Zhang Lian turned and ran into a nearby alley. I grabbed Xie Tingting's hand tightly and followed Zhang Lian. The kidnappers were hot on our heels.
"I'm sorry, we'll swim for it!" I shouted at the kidnappers, making them subconsciously step back.
But as soon as I turned around, I jumped into the riverbank with Zhang Lian and Xie Tingting, plunging into the river.
As soon as the river water engulfed us, Zhang Lian loosened her grip on Xie Tingting's waist. I knew she was just as frightened as I was.
The river swept the three of us downstream, and as I sank, I grabbed Xie Tingting's arm, but she, who had already swallowed several mouthfuls of river water, was too panicked and clung tightly to me with her arms around my chest.
With two teenage girls hanging on me, one of whom was the school's recognized beauty, this was supposed to be an enviable situation for everyone, but right now, all I wanted to do was shout for help!
Just then, a whirlpool suddenly formed below, pulling the three of us down together.
I thought we were done for.
When our bodies are found, I wonder what those newspapers will say about us.
Two teenage girls accompany each other in a suicide pact with a philandering teenager?
I don't know whether to laugh or cry..."
