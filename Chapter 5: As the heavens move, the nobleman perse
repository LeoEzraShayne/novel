Chapter 5: As the heavens move, the nobleman perseveres!

Fu Changshi placed us in a dilapidated house outside the palace. He claimed to have believed that we were indeed from another sea, but I knew he was lying. However, at this moment, I didn't care. What mattered most to me right now... was that Xie Tingting was sick.
Ever since that miraculous melody inexplicably emanated, she fell ill and couldn't recover.
I had no money to afford her medical treatment. In this world, currency consisted of strange leaves called Qingtong leaves and Zishan leaves, of which I didn't even know what they looked like.
No one was willing to help us; everyone's gaze was indifferent. I didn't want to complain about it. In any world, the universe doesn't revolve around a few individuals, especially when this place was never meant to be our world. In their eyes, Zhang Lian and Xie Tingting were just wingless anomalies, and I was a scum who had betrayed my own position.
I tried to seek a physician, but no one was willing to come.
As the sun set and the moonlight shone, I walked alone on the streets. I looked up and saw two moons rising in the sky, one large and exceptionally bright, the other smaller and dimmer, almost imperceptible beside the larger one.
Later, I learned that there were no stars in the night sky of this world, only these two moons. The larger one was called Yulun, and the smaller one was called Lengyue.
Returning to our residence, Zhang Lian's voice came from the inner room: "Yunuo... Is it you? Please don't come in."
But I had already reached the door. The dim moonlight seeped through the old gauze window and illuminated the room. I saw her sitting on the bed, wearing only a bra and lace panties, wiping her body with water. The scene was blurred yet stirring, but even in the dim light, the whip marks on her back were visible, filling my heart with sadness.
I left the door and leaned against the wall, sitting down.
Xie Tingting's voice came from the inner room: "Couldn't you find a doctor?"
I helplessly responded with a grunt.
She didn't say anything more, probably already anticipating such an outcome.
I told her that I had inquired, and there might be job opportunities at the square on the west street. Tomorrow, I planned to give it a try. She murmured a "Good luck."
The next morning, I begged a kind old man next door for a bowl of gruel.
Zhang Lian fed a few spoonfuls to the unconscious Tingting, but she couldn't swallow. The remaining gruel was shared between the two of us. I had lied to Zhang Lian, saying I had eaten outside, but she knew I was lying.
I went to the square on the west street. There were many people waiting for work, and many seeking workers, but for some reason, no one approached me. Some were even skinnier and smaller than me, yet none looked my way... these people didn't even dare to meet my eyes.
I wasted the whole day on the square.
As dusk approached, the crowd gradually dispersed. I coldly watched a few individuals coming in and out of the corner. Although they seemed to be passing by, I knew they had been watching me all along.
I pretended to walk back home dejectedly, but suddenly turned around, knocking down a passing man and punching him hard in the face. He was stunned, unsure of how to react.
"Take me to see the one surnamed Fu," I shouted at him.
Several people rushed over and tackled me to the ground. I felt a bit crazed at that moment, kicking down several guys with my feet. But ultimately, they pinned me down.
"Take me to see the one surnamed Fu!" I yelled again, struggling under their hold.
In an official residence, I met Fu Changshi again. He looked at me, expressionless.
"You don't really believe we're from another sea," I said bitterly. "You pretended to believe in our innocence but sent people to spy on us secretly. You just want to see what we'll do, to find some leverage against us."
"It seems you're not entirely foolish," Fu Changshi said flatly. "So, can you tell me now, who you really are, and what purpose brought you here?"
"I've already said...," I began.
"You've said you're from another sea," his gaze turned icy. "Do you truly believe such words would convince anyone? If you were from another sea, why could that girl play 'Liankong' yesterday?"
"'Liankong'? What's that?"
"'Liankong' is the tune that girl played in the palace. It's one of the Seven Celestial Melodies, originally only playable by members of the royal family," he looked at me coldly. "Now, tell me, why could that girl play a tune that doesn't belong to your world?"
This question... I also wanted to know. No wonder they didn't believe we were from another sea. I took a deep breath, forcing myself to calm down, and looked at Fu Changshi. "Since you've seen through it, I don't want to hide anymore. You're right, we're not from another sea."
"Then who are you?"
"Do you want to know?" I tried to keep my expression unchanged as much as possible. "If you want to know, first find a physician to cure Tingting's illness. As long as you heal her, I'll tell you the truth."
"Why should I believe you?"
"Don't you want to know the secrets we're hiding?" Although I tried to keep a straight face, I couldn't help but laugh... laugh a bit crazily.
"Don't you want to know why we risked being burned alive to come here?" I didn't know why I was laughing like this, even to the point of my stomach hurting. "Don't you want to know why Tingting, clearly a Night Demoness, could play 'Liankong'? Don't you want to know why the herbs you mixed in the water yesterday had no effect on them? I'll tell you everything once you heal her."
What kind of world is this?
Why doesn't anyone believe the truth, but lies become reality?
"It's also possible that even if we cure her, you still won't speak the truth."
"But if she dies, the chances of you knowing the truth will be even lower," I continued laughing, although my stomach was starting to ache. "I've said it, as long as you cure her illness, I'll tell you everything. What else can I do? Even if she recovers, our lives are still in your hands."
Fu Changshi remained silent for a moment, then turned to a soldier and ordered, "Get a physician!"
As I was escorted back to our residence, the sky had already darkened, with the two moons hanging in the sky.
The night wind was cold, chilling to the bone.
I took a step forward... but didn't know where the path lay..."
